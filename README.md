# SI-618-FinalProject

Using the Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) Mental Health in Tech Survey, I deployed random forest classifier models to determine the most relevant feature for predicting: Whether or not someone has discussed a mental health issue with their supervisor, and Whether or not someone feels comfortable discussing mental health with their supervisor. I used tokenizations and lemmatizations to compare conversations about mental health with supervisors vs. fellow employees, and to compare how suggestions about how to improve mental health practices at work differ from previous years. 

.csv files from both the 2017 & 2019 OMSI Surveys are included in the data folder. .ipynb notebook and html version of source code, PDF of report and findings are included as well.
